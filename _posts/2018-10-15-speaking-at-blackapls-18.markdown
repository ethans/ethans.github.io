I'm going to be talking this November at the BlackAlps conference in Switzerland about securing the development life cycle in cyber security software.

If you're attending the conference - come say hi, I'd love to meet new people and learn new things. If you aren't attending - then consider doing so.

See more about the conference on the [BlackAlps'18][black-alps-18] website and read about my talk [Dilemmas Everywhere! Get it right or get pwned][ethan-talk-ba18].
